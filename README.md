Got it! Let’s adjust the overview to focus more on the external context about population growth affecting wildlife, and the urgency of taking action to protect endangered species in Tennessee before it’s too late. Here's the revised version:

# TN Growth, Convenience Centers, and Wildlife Impact

## Overview

Population growth is often linked to negative effects on wildlife and biodiversity. As urban areas expand, natural habitats are encroached upon, and industrial activities increase, leading to habitat destruction, pollution, and threats to endangered species. This project uses Tennessee’s population data from 2020 to 2024 to highlight the increasing population pressure on the environment, particularly on wildlife. The goal is to raise awareness of the need for urgent action to protect endangered species and their habitats before it's too late.

By combining external data sources on population growth, toxic releases, oil and gas activities, and rare species locations, this project aims to present a clearer picture of how Tennessee’s growth could threaten its wildlife and emphasize the importance of establishing or strengthening wildlife protection areas and conservation efforts.

## Problem Statement

With Tennessee's population increasing between 2020 and 2024, it is crucial to examine the potential consequences of this growth on the state's wildlife and ecosystems. While the data does not directly correlate population growth to wildlife impacts, it provides essential insights into areas of potential risk. Population growth often leads to urban sprawl, increased industrial activities, and greater demands on natural resources, all of which can disrupt ecosystems and endanger species.

This project seeks to highlight regions in Tennessee where population growth, industrial activities (such as toxic releases and oil and gas extraction), and rare species overlap, indicating areas where intervention is needed to prevent further habitat destruction and species extinction. The goal is to emphasize the importance of protecting wildlife before irreversible damage occurs.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Excel  
   - Python (pandas, numpy)

- **Data Visualization:**  
   - Tableau

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning:**  
   The raw data from the various sources was collected and cleaned using Python and Excel. This involved handling missing values, converting data types, and ensuring consistency across datasets.

2. **Analysis:**  
   - Population growth from 2020 to 2024 was calculated and analyzed.
   - Industrial activities (toxic release, oil & gas extraction, and waste disposal) were mapped to assess their proximity to rare species and wildlife habitats.
   - The focus was on identifying areas where population growth could lead to additional environmental pressure on wildlife, especially in areas lacking sufficient protection or conservation efforts.

3. **Data Visualization:**  
   Tableau was used to create visualizations that highlight key insights, such as population density trends, toxic release areas, and the locations of endangered species in relation to industrial zones and urban growth.

## Findings

This analysis aims to identify regions in Tennessee where population growth and industrial activities could pose a threat to endangered species and their habitats. Key findings may include:
- Areas where population density is increasing rapidly but where wildlife refuges or conservation areas are absent.
- Locations where toxic releases or oil and gas extraction overlap with rare species habitats, posing a risk to biodiversity.
- Regions where there is a critical need for wildlife protection or conservation intervention to prevent further species decline or extinction.

## Future Work

- Further analysis can include exploring additional data sources such as climate change effects or agricultural expansion to assess additional risks to wildlife.
